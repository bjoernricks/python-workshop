# Tooling

* Wherever we are doing live coding the [VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) is used
* Why?
	* Easier Setup
    * Better Overview
	* Code Highlighting
	* Code Completion
    * A Terminal is included
	* `shift+enter` to run current line or selected Python code
