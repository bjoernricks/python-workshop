# Strings

Strings in Python are immutable. That means all operations on strings create new
string objects. They are based on Unicode.

Strings can be defined by using single *'* or double quotes *"*.

## Defining a string

```{literalinclude} quotes.py
```

## Concatenating

```{literalinclude} concat.py
```

## Built in functionality

```{literalinclude} methods.py
```

## Length

```{literalinclude} len.py
```

## Index access

```{literalinclude} getitem.py
```

## Slicing

Getting parts of a string

```{literalinclude} slicing.py
```

## f-Strings

*Formatted string literals* or just f-strings are a new and improved way to
format strings in Python. They are available since Python 3.6.

```{literalinclude} f_strings.py
```
