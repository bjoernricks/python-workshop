# Functions have return values

We did take a look at the input of functions. Now lets take a look at the
output.

Functions have always return values. If no return statement is given, `None` is
returned implicitly.

Example with implicit return value:

```{literalinclude} implicit.py
```

Example with explicit return value:

```{literalinclude} explicit.py
```
