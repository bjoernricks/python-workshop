# Functions

The purpose of a function is to group business logic into a re-usable unit.

A function is defined by starting a line with the `def` keyword followed by a
function name, an opening brace, a closing brace and a colon. The code within
the function needs to be indented.

The function itself can be called by stating the function name and the braces.

Example:

```{literalinclude} hello_world.py
```

Next:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 2
1/arguments
2/keyword
3/defaults
4/return
5/require
```
