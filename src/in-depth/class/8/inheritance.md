# Adding Class Inheritance

It is possible to derive classes from other classes. To call the a method like
the constructor of the parent class the `super` function can be used.

With the example the developer doesn't need to know about the kind of a `Fruit`
anymore. It is possible to create a specific fruit object instead.

Example:

```{literalinclude} example.py
```
