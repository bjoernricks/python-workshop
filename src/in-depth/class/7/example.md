# Class Example

Lets start with a basic stupid example using classes.

We have two classes:
* `Fruit` representing a fruit and
* `Basket` representing a fruit basket containing a collection of fruits.

Fruit instances have a kind. It's possible to add fruits to a basket and to
print the content of a basket.
