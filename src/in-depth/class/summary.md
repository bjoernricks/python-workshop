# Summary

* Classes can be used to structure code into a single *piece*
* Classes don't necessarily need to represent the reality
* Classes have data (or also called *state*) and behavior
* Classes can inherit data and behavior by deriving from other classes
* You don't need to use inheritance in Python for implementing and using
  similar class behavior
* Python itself uses *dunder* methods for defining and implementing specific
  class behavior without using inheritance
