# Classes

Classes in general are for structuring something into a logical distinct unit.

* Python classes are defined by a **class** statement following a name
* Python classes can have **variables** and **methods**.
* An instance of a class is called an **object**.
* (Nearly) everything in Python is a class. Even functions.
